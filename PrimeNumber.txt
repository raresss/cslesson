finding Prime numbers:


 STEPS:
1.you first divide the number (x) by 2 and see if it gives 0. it it does not, erase all the numbers that are higher than the quotient of x:2


2.  divide x by 3 and if it does not give rest 0, then erase all the numbers that are higher than the quotient of x:3 until you reach 
the last unerased number.
