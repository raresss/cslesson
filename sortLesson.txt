Step 1: Understand the problem
  we have 9 numbers and we need to order them. we use a programme to arrange them properly. 
  
  Step 2: make the model
 a) select the first number 
 b)compare it with the next numbers and find which one is smaller
 c) Now select the smallwe number and compare it with the next .Find which one is smaller.
 d) Repeat this step until the end of all the numbers.this way you will know which is the smallest number.
 e) Replace the smallest number with the first number of the series 
 f) Forget about the first number and start the process with the next number. until we finish the whole list.


Step 3: formulate the algorithm: 

a) select a box 
b)copy the first number
c) compare it with the second number , third, fourth, etc.
d) we put the first number in the place of the lowest number 
e) we put the number from the selection box in the place of the first box
f)put the next number in the selection box 
g) repeat steps b) to f) until we finish the whole numbers list.
