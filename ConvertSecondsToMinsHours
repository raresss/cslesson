Steps:
1. divide the inputseconds by 60 to get the number of mins 
2.divide the mins by 60 to get the number of hours
3. write down the number of hours and the final minutes ( 1h, 5 min for example).



inputsecs = 3929
mins = inputsecs // 60
mins = 3929//60 
hours = mins // 60 
finalmins = mins%60
print(hours, ":", finalmins)
